#####      File Server settings      #####
##########################################
# Salt runs a lightweight file server written in zeromq to deliver files to
# minions. This file server is built into the master daemon and does not
# require a dedicated port.

# The file server works on environments passed to the master, each environment
# can have multiple root directories, the subdirectories in the multiple file
# roots cannot match, otherwise the downloaded files will not be able to be
# reliably ensured. A base environment is required to house the top file.
# Example:
# file_roots:
#   base:
#     - /srv/salt/
#   dev:
#     - /srv/salt/dev/services
#     - /srv/salt/dev/states
#   prod:
#     - /srv/salt/prod/services
#     - /srv/salt/prod/states

file_roots:
  base:
    - /srv/salt/files/base
  prod:
    - /srv/salt/files/prod

#file_roots:
#  base:
#    - /srv/salt

# The hash_type is the hash to use when discovering the hash of a file on
# the master server. The default is md5, but sha1, sha224, sha256, sha384
# and sha512 are also supported.
#
# Prior to changing this value, the master should be stopped and all Salt 
# caches should be cleared.
#
#hash_type: md5

# The buffer size in the file server can be adjusted here:
#file_buffer_size: 1048576

# A regular expression (or a list of expressions) that will be matched
# against the file path before syncing the modules and states to the minions.
# This includes files affected by the file.recurse state.
# For example, if you manage your custom modules and states in subversion
# and don't want all the '.svn' folders and content synced to your minions,
# you could set this to '/\.svn($|/)'. By default nothing is ignored.
#
#file_ignore_regex:
#  - '/\.svn($|/)'
#  - '/\.git($|/)'

# A file glob (or list of file globs) that will be matched against the file
# path before syncing the modules and states to the minions. This is similar
# to file_ignore_regex above, but works on globs instead of regex. By default
# nothing is ignored.
#
# file_ignore_glob:
#  - '*.pyc'
#  - '*/somefolder/*.bak'
#  - '*.swp'

# File Server Backend
# Salt supports a modular fileserver backend system, this system allows
# the salt master to link directly to third party systems to gather and
# manage the files available to minions. Multiple backends can be
# configured and will be searched for the requested file in the order in which
# they are defined here. The default setting only enables the standard backend
# "roots" which uses the "file_roots" option.
#
#fileserver_backend:
#  - roots
#
# To use multiple backends list them in the order they are searched:
#
#fileserver_backend:
#  - git
#  - roots
#
# Uncomment the line below if you do not want the file_server to follow
# symlinks when walking the filesystem tree. This is set to True
# by default. Currently this only applies to the default roots
# fileserver_backend.
#
#fileserver_followsymlinks: False
#
# Uncomment the line below if you do not want symlinks to be
# treated as the files they are pointing to. By default this is set to
# False. By uncommenting the line below, any detected symlink while listing
# files on the Master will not be returned to the Minion.
#
#fileserver_ignoresymlinks: True
#
# By default, the Salt fileserver recurses fully into all defined environments
# to attempt to find files. To limit this behavior so that the fileserver only
# traverses directories with SLS files and special Salt directories like _modules,
# enable the option below. This might be useful for installations where a file root
# has a very large number of files and performance is impacted. Default is False.
#
# fileserver_limit_traversal: False
#
# The fileserver can fire events off every time the fileserver is updated,
# these are disabled by default, but can be easily turned on by setting this
# flag to True
#fileserver_events: False
#
# Git fileserver backend configuration
#
# Gitfs can be provided by one of two python modules: GitPython or pygit2. If
# using pygit2, both libgit2 and git must also be installed.
#gitfs_provider: gitpython
#
# When using the git fileserver backend at least one git remote needs to be
# defined. The user running the salt master will need read access to the repo.
#
# The repos will be searched in order to find the file requested by a client
# and the first repo to have the file will return it.
# When using the git backend branches and tags are translated into salt
# environments.
# Note:  file:// repos will be treated as a remote, so refs you want used must
# exist in that repo as *local* refs.
#
#gitfs_remotes:
#  - git://github.com/saltstack/salt-states.git
#  - file:///var/git/saltmaster
#
# The gitfs_ssl_verify option specifies whether to ignore ssl certificate
# errors when contacting the gitfs backend. You might want to set this to
# false if you're using a git backend that uses a self-signed certificate but
# keep in mind that setting this flag to anything other than the default of True
# is a security concern, you may want to try using the ssh transport.
#gitfs_ssl_verify: True
#
#
# The gitfs_root option gives the ability to serve files from a subdirectory
# within the repository. The path is defined relative to the root of the
# repository and defaults to the repository root.
#gitfs_root: somefolder/otherfolder
